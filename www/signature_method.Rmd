Genewise negative binomial generalized log-linear models with quasi-likelihood tests and genewise exact tests from bioconductor package [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html) are used to calculate differential expression between groups with and without covariates respectively. Control group is considered as reference in computing log of fold change and p-values are adjusted for multiple comparison.
