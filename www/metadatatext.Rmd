<span style="color:#337ab7">Criteria for filtering metadata</span></h4> </center>

GEO metadata contains a lot of information. However, not all of these information are useful for analysis or visualization. Besides the full metadata, we also provide a filtered version of the metadata. We filter the metadata based on the follwoing criteria: 

* Columns that contain a single value
* Columns with incoherent information regarding analysis and visualization such as dates, time, download path and so on.
